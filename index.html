<h1>Jason's Website</h1>

<p>	
    Hello, I am Qing Wei Zhang. Qing Wei is my first name. If that is hard to roll off your tongue then Jason 
    is probably easier. I am currently a fifth-year economics student at The University of British Columbia. 
    I was born in China and moved to Canada after the completion of grade 5. 

    <br> 
    I took my first CS course near the end of the second year and fell in love after that. 
    I found CS fundamentally similar to economics and thus continued taking CS courses for my electives. 
    My main interests are algorithms (difficult but fascinating) and basically anything on how various parts of a computer works. 
    Thus I took courses in these topics.
    I’ve already completed all my requirements but I hope to take more CS courses while I can and that is why I am in fifth year.
